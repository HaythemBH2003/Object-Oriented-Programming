###### OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ######
''' Every thing we use in python code  is 
    an Object of a known Class. '''

''' A new variable is an Object which is 
    an Instance of a Class  that defines
    the way the Object interacts with the
    other parts of the code. '''

''' Built-in Classes work differently Ex: 
    int / str / function / lists '''

###   Some Previously  Used Objects   ###

def hello():
    print("hello")
string = "AAAA"
integer = 1
my_list = ["aa", 1, "bb"]

print(type(string))     #  str is a Class

print(type(integer))    #  int is a Class

print(type(my_list))    # list is a class

print(type(hello))      #  hello  is   an 
                        #  object of  the  
                        #  Class function
                #  type(x) ---> type of x
                #    where x is an Object
